# IHME Assessment
This repo contains the code used to produce my IHME technical assessment results, figures, and notebook.  
`R/ihme-notebook.Rmd` is an R markdown file that contains both the code and answers to the assessment questions in one notebook style document.  
Cloning this repo and placing the .CSV that was delivered with the assessment instructions in the empty `data/` directory will allow anyone to seamlessly run `R/ihme-notebook.Rmd` to replicate the results that I have submitted.
